(* in graph -> A* out *)
(*
A* will pop every node of some f-value (= f_max) or less in finite time.
in particular, a goal node (with some path) z has some f(z) = g(z) + h(z) (where h is just a function and g depends on the path). this, as a function of the nodes with smaller or equal f-values, bounds the number of steps that A* must take before getting to z.

the problem is that since f is only monotonic. i.e. f(y) >= f(x) implies that f(y) may equal f(x); however, each time a child y of node x is pushed onto the priority queue with priortity f(y), since the weights of the graph are strictly positive, g(y) > g(x), and for f(y) = f(x), then it must be that h(y) < h(x); h is nonnegative, so after finitely many such steps, h will decrease to zero, and then g must increase until it is the f_max.

for this, i could define an A* Fixpoint that decreases on the f-value. however, since there are a few arguments that may decrease:
f_max - f_curr  ==>  0
f_max - g_curr  ==>  0
h_curr          ==>  0

g always increases, but either f increases or h decreases, and i think i need to prove this non-structural recursion terminates (like you do with mergesort).

i thought of proving an easier theorem, that BFS is complete (perhaps strengthening the assumptions with knowing the maximum breadth), as an instance of my definition of A*.

BFS is A* with
h _ = 0
w _ _ = 1

thus
f = g + h = g = depth

but i ran out of time
